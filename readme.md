
# Introduction

This is a demonstration of the infamous loop issue or [the notorius closure loop](http://javascript.info/tutorial/closures) in JavaScript.

In addition, this example contains fiddling with Angular promises, even though these two features are really separate.

The demo runs on an EAN stack (no 'M').

The interesting code is in `MainCtrl.js`. See the console for output.
